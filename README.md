# PREDICTIVE-AND-PRESCRIPTIVE-ANALYSIS-ON-XAU
The "Predictive and Prescriptive Analysis on XAU" framework blends technical analysis, machine learning, and fuzzy logic for accurate gold market predictions. It integrates real-world news and offers insights for trading strategies.

This project encapsulates a multifaceted and sophisticated approach to analyzing and forecasting gold prices, incorporating a diverse set of tools and methodologies from data collection and statistical analysis to machine learning and fuzzy logic. Commencing with the retrieval of historical gold price data through the Yahoo Finance API, the script embarks on a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), unveiling insights into trends, rolling statistics, and distribution patterns. Statistical analyses, such as T-tests, assess the significance of price differences before and after a predefined split date, shedding light on the market's dynamics. The script ventures into machine learning with the construction of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) fused with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) using the Keras library, engaging in the intricate task of time series prediction for gold prices. It employs Google's Generative AI to dynamically generate textual content related to current news about the gold market, subsequently converting this text into audible speech. In pursuit of model robustness, an ensemble approach is adopted, wherein two independent instances of the CNN-GRU model are trained and their predictions harmonized to form a more robust forecasting mechanism. The technical underpinnings of trading strategies are explored through the calculation of moving averages, yielding actionable buy and sell signals. Backtesting procedures are enacted to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of the proposed trading strategy, with the results visually portrayed for clarity. The script broadens its analytical scope by scrutinizing the correlation between gold prices and influential. The inclusion of fuzzy logic introduces a nuanced perspective, determining the strength of buy signals based on the nuanced changes in gold prices.
